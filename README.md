**Easyadmin ESX Logs**
https://blumlaut.tebex.io/package/4455820

**DISCLAIMER** 
I DID NOT MAKE THE PLUGIN NOR EASYADMIN FULL CREDIT TO 
https://github.com/Blumlaut FOR EASYADMIN AND THE PLUGIN ITSELF 

**DO NOT STRIP CREDIT OF MY LOGS, DO NO REMOVE THE FOTTER AT THE LOGS**

**THIS WILL ONLY WORK IF YOU DO HAVE THE PLUGIN, THIS JUST REPLACES THE Server.lua IN THE EASYADMIN PLUGIN FOLDER!!** 

 *Installation instructions* 
> easyadmin - plugins - esx - replace the server.lua 

*REMINDER THIS IS NOT THE PLUGIN, ITS A REWRITE OF THE SERVER.LUA FILE FOR LOGS OF WHAT ADMINS DO!*
